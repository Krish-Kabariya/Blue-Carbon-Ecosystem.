# Blue-Carbon-Ecosystem.
Blue carbon ecosystems—mangroves, seagrass meadows, and salt marshes—capture and store large amounts of carbon, often faster than forests. They protect coasts, support biodiversity, and aid fisheries. When degraded, they release stored carbon, worsening climate change. Safeguarding them is vital for nature and people.
